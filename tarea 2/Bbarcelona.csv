Under Archsense Apartments and ArchSense Barcelona brands, we are a young and dynamic company that is dedicated to personalized management of tourist apartments and houses in two diferent areas in Spain. In Barcelona  (Catalunya) and Pontevedra (Galicia).

Our management comprises different phases, from the initial search of clients, reception and accommodation in the apartment until his departure. We also take care of the apartment all clean and conditioning time, and to resolve any issues that may arise during a guest's stay.
The main goal of our management is twofold:

- Provide the owner a full service under which you can forget about the worries and concerns the operation of holiday rental, knowing that the investment in the business will bring greater benefits than the option of ""traditional"" rent.
- Get the highest customer satisfaction, ensuring their comfort, in order to make your stay in our apartments result in all the most pleasant time possible.

Our differences with other organizations dedicated to the tourist apartment sector lies in providing special pampering to the customer, feeling to be at their own home and have at all the time a ""friend"" of reference in the city. This person (me or some of my collaborators) speaks your language, and will help you to solve any questions or problems and looking for suggestions of leisure in the city. 
All this expertise  has allowed us to grow gradually, as the viral marketing has proven to be our best advertising tool, and thus many customers and many others have repeated recommend us to their family and friends.

I was born in Hungary, but I have been lucky enough to have lived most of my life abroad. We moved to Canada when I was only 3 and with 2 intermissions in Hungary I have also lived in the United States, Sweden and now in Spain.

After such a ‚Äúbusy‚Äù childhood and youth perhaps it‚Äôs not surprising that I went on to get a degree in Social Anthropology (in Sweden, where I moved to with my parents at 17). But of course 5 years of dark and rainy grey weather takes its toll on the soul and I decided to take a leap and moved to Barcelona to study Spanish. Since Barcelona is a very attractive city I decided to stay a bit longer and got my master‚Äôs in Cultural Management. Right after finishing I started working for a small design agency. I completed a masters degree in art therapy and am currently looking for opportunities to work in the field. And in the mean time I teach English as a freelance teacher.

I also had a nomad lifestyle, coming and going from Barcelona to Papua New Guinea, during the last 3 years prior to the pandemic.  

During my PhD in Barcelona, I used Airbnb and shared my apartment with travellers. Most reviews in my host profile are from that time. It was a very nice experience. Nowadays, I have to be mostly based in Barcelona (due to the difficulty to travel due to COVID-19 pandemic), and some of my research projects in the tropics are on hold. So I decided to activate my host profile again, to share my apartment temporarly with people looking for short stays in Barcelona, interested in a home-like housing.  In summer, or when my field work is re-activated, I might leave the city for few motnhs and rent the full apartment.

Paral.lel is an avenue that cuts down from picturesque Pla√ßa Espanya right down to the World Trade Centre at the tip of the port. Poble Sec is an area spreading out from the middle of Paral.lel.<br /><br />The areas are safe and primarily residential but there is much entertainment to be had as well. This includes popular bars, theatre and even a club. However, whilst Paral.lel is a busy thoroughfare during the day, the areas are quiet and just a 10-20 minute walk to the centre of the city and Las Ramblas. A good choice if you want to be central but away from the crowds of tourists that populate more central areas.<br /><br />Montju√Øc and Pla√ßa Espanya are also very close by.
